# Prediction of future sales in Walmart
Dong Qin

## Project overview
Accurate sales predictions enable companies to make informed business decisions and forecast short-term and long-term performance. Sales predictions also gives insight into how a company should manage its workforce, cash flow, and resources.
In this project, we aim to predict the future sales in Walmart based on the purchase history. We first analyse and explore the basic information of the provided dataset, and then extracted useful features. Based on the extracted features, we build various regression models to predict future sales. In order to improve the regression performance, all these models are ensembled via stacking.
Project goal
Overall goal of this project is to estimate, as precisely as possible, the point forecasts of the unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart. Specifically, we use hierarchical and historic sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next days.
